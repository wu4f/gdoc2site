   Upper Division CS Courses Before Admission
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p class="c1">
  <span class="c19">
   Students require at least 56 credits of upper division CS courses (or 52 credits for those using a Catalog from before Fall 2023). However, there is also a requirement that
  </span>
  <span class="c6">
   students must complete at least 44 of those credits
  </span>
  <span class="c11">
   after
  </span>
  <span class="c6">
   admission
  </span>
  <span class="c3">
   . As a result:
  </span>
 </p>
 <ul class="c17 lst-kix_vmrp5p68ffgj-0 start">
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Students using the Fall 2023 catalog (or later) can take a maximum of 12 credits (3 courses) of upper division CS classes prior to admission.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Students using an earlier catalog can take a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) of upper division CS classes prior to admission.
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="c1">
  <span class="c3">
   A limited number of specific upper division CS classes (CS 302, CS 350, and CS 486) are available to students before admission.
  </span>
 </p>
 <ul class="c17 lst-kix_y3zty2nbzpp4-0 start">
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Students registering for these courses prior to admission must be careful to avoid exceeding the credit limits described above.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Students must have junior standing or higher (90+ credits) to register for these courses.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Credits for any other upper division CS courses taken prior to admission (as a result of an approved transfer, for example), will also count towards these limits.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Students should generally plan to take these courses in the same term that they complete the opt-in; taking these classes earlier than that may result in a gap in available courses that could delay progress in the major for one or more terms.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c0 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c5 c8">
    Students with special circumstances who plan to take any of these courses prior to opt-in should talk to their advisor to ensure they have a plan that will meet their needs.
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="c1">
  <span class="c3">
   Other courses that students might consider during the term when they opt-in, without impacting the credit limit, include PHL 314U, general education courses (arts and letters/social science, or junior cluster courses, for example) or math electives.
