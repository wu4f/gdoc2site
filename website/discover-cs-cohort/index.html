   <span class="c0">
    When does the cohort start?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    The next cohort will start in Fall 2025. Classes will meet in person on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:00 a.m. to 12:40 p.m. During the first week of class, you will select a required Friday lab time: either 10:00 11:50 a.m. or 3:00 4:50 p.m. Class and lab days and times will remain the same throughout all three terms. Another benefit of joining the cohort - you'll know your schedule now!
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c0">
    What are the class sizes?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    Each course will have a maximum of 30-36 students and meet twice a week. Students will also meet once a week in smaller groups of 10-12 students. The smaller group meetings will be run by a former student who has recently completed CS 161, CS 162, and CS 163 and will remain with you throughout your journey in a mentor role.

   <span class="c0">
    Will I be taking all three courses with the same instructor?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    Yes! That is one of the benefits of the cohort, developing a relationship with your instructor so they know how to best support you.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c0">
    Will the courses be on the same day and time each term?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    Yes, you can rely on a consistent day and time each term.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c0">
    I have no prior computer science experience, is this class for me?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    Yes! This cohort is designed specifically for students with no prior experience.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c0">
    What if I enroll in the cohort sections, but for other reasons, cannot continue with the cohort?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    We understand that life happens and plans change. If you need to leave the cohort at any time, rest assured you will be prepared to complete the remaining classes outside of the cohort.

    I am majoring in another discipline, why should I consider computer science?
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    Technology influences nearly every field of study and impacts almost every aspect of our lives. It is important for all students, regardless of major, to develop real digital competencies alongside their own specialization areas, especially in areas that are increasingly informed by digital and computational environments, such as healthcare, education, and social services.

    Will there be an annotation or other difference on my transcript indicating that I completed the introductory course sequence within the cohort?

   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    No, the course numbers are the same and you will be meeting the same course objectives as the other sections.
