   Accreditation

 <p class="c0">
  <span class="c13">
   The Portland State undergraduate Bachelor of Science Computer Science degree program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,

  <span class="c14 c35">

   , under the General Criteria and the Computer Science and Similarly Named Computing Program Criteria.  This national organization sets standards for computer science education defined in terms of curricular content, quality of faculty, and adequacy of facilities.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="c0">
  <span class="c10">
   Accreditation certifies that a program meets or exceeds the minimum criteria for quality education, ensuring a quality educational experience for students.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="c0">
  <span class="c10">
   Accreditation has two advantages for students:
  </span>
 </p>
 <ol class="c3 lst-kix_z1l4zq1nyu2p-0 start" start="1">
  <li class="c15 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c4">
    Accreditation is a form of quality control. The CAC sets minimum standards for every aspect of a degree program, and, periodically, they send an evaluation team to examine everything from the degree requirements (which are stiffer than average, at their insistence) to the way classes are conducted and graded. The evaluation team will also interview students, staff, and faculty, and examine our facilities, and curriculum materials. A program is accredited only if everything is up to par.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li class="c15 li-bullet-0">
   <span class="c4">
    Accreditation adds real market value to the degree. For example, some companies (particularly those accustomed to hiring engineers) pay better starting salaries, and sometimes job titles, if the employee comes from an accredited degree program.

   Student Outcomes
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p class="c22">
  <span class="c10">
   Students in the undergraduate program in Computer Science are expected to master the following competencies (learning based student outcomes). Reflecting the high-level structure, the list is organized as two groups, one focused on skills outcomes (using labels that begin with A) and the other on knowledge outcomes (using labels that begin with B).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="c22">
  <span class="c10">
   Graduates of the undergraduate program in computer science will have an ability to:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="c22">
  <span class="c10">
   A1. Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
   <br/>
   A2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline.
   <br/>
   A3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
   <br/>
   A4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed and equitable judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
   <br/>
   A5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program's discipline.
   <br/>
   A6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="c22">
  <span class="c10">
   B1. Apply knowledge and skills in the foundations of computer science.
   <br/>
   B2. Apply knowledge and skills in the area of systems and data.
