<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Handbook describes policies and procedures for graduate students in
Computer Science at Portland State University. It should be read in conjunction
with the relevant university requirements described in the <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/bulletin/">PSU Bulletin</a> and
the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/current-students">Graduate School
website</a>. Some of the most important university-level requirements are
restated here, but not all of them; if any differences exist, the Bulletin and
Graduate School rules take priority over this Handbook. It is the student’s
responsibility to be familiar with both university and departmental
requirements.
</p>
<p>
This Handbook is revised annually by the CS Director of Graduate Studies.
</p>
<p>
For questions regarding the topics in this handbook, or to suggest additions or
improvements to its contents, please contact the CS Graduate Advisor (<a
href="mailto:gccs@pdx.edu">gccs@pdx.edu</a>).
</p>
<h2 id="2-admissions">2 Admissions</h2>
<p>
The Master of Science (M.S.) is the first graduate degree in the field. Students
entering the program must have a bachelor's degree and/or adequate background in
computer science, such as obtaining an undergraduate computer science program.
</p>
<p>
The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is the highest degree offered in any
discipline. Students may enter the doctoral program with a bachelor's degree or
with a master's degree, and must have adequate background in computer science.
</p>
<h3 id="2-1-admission-requirements">2.1 Admission Requirements</h3>
<p>
To be considered for admission, all applicants to the CS graduate programs must
have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A four-year baccalaureate degree from an accredited
institution<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0</li>
<li>Proof of<a

<h2 id="4-master’s-degree-m-s">4 Master’s Degree (M.S.)</h2>
<h3 id="4-1-introduction">4.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science is the initial graduate degree
in the field. The master's program is designed to prepare students for advanced
careers in the computing industry and/or for graduate work at the Ph.D. level.
Students entering the program must have a bachelor's degree, typically in
Computer Science. Students with a degree in another discipline may be admitted
if they have adequate background in Computer Science; the <a
href="#6-grad-prep-program">Grad Prep program</a> can be a useful bridge into
the field.
</p>
<p>
The master's program requires the completion of an approved program of 45
credits, with a thesis option. Coursework includes core courses in theory and
programming practice, plus a 9-credit concentration in one specialization area.
The M.S. degree typically takes one and a half years of full-time study to
complete. Students are also welcome to pursue the degree on a part-time basis.
</p>
<h3 id="4-2-degree-requirements">4.2 Degree requirements</h3>
<p>
The 45 credits required for the M.S. degree fall into three categories: Core
Requirements, Track Requirements, and Electives.
</p>
<h4 id="4-2-1-core-requirements-6">4.2.1 Core Requirements (6)</h4>
<p>
Students are encouraged to take these courses as early as possible in their
graduate program.
</p>
<p>
One Theory course from:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CS 581 Theory of Computation (3)</li>
<li>CS 584 Algorithm Design & Analysis (3)</li>
<li>CS 578 Programming Language Semantics (3)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="4-2-2-track-requirements-9">4.2.2 Track Requirements (9)</h4>
<p>
All students in the CS Master's program must take three courses from one of the
following tracks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Languages & Programming</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Systems & Networking</li>
<li>Theory</li>
<li>Visual Computing</li>
</ul>
<p>
This track requirement is intended to ensure that each student obtains deep
exposure to some specialized area of Computer Science. Note that the track
selection appears on the student’s Plan of Study and DARS audit, but does
<strong>not</strong> appear on the transcript or the diploma.
</p>
<p>
The list of required courses and approved electives for each track are listed
below. The list of approved electives for a track may change over time; a course
counts as approved if it is on the current list at the time it is taken. In
addition to regularly numbered courses (CS511 and above), most tracks allow <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zzyb9E1zLwQ0TYErZfoW9i2BM83b_PFba6zWmzMELQs/edit#gid=0">certain
CS510 courses</a> to be counted as electives. Occasionally, courses not listed
can be allowed towards a track; enquiries about this should be directed to the
CS Graduate Advisor.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-3-advising">4.3 Advising</h3>
<p>
The CS Graduate Advisor (<a href="mailto:gccs@pdx.edu">gccs@pdx.edu</a>) is the
primary advisor for all M.S. students. Every M.S. student is required to
maintain a <a href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/MS-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">Plan of Study form</a>, 
which outlines both courses taken so far towards the
degree and courses planned for the remainder of the program. The Plan of Study
will also note any transfer and pre-admission courses, non-CS courses, and the
student’s intended track.<br><br>Full-time students should submit
an initial Plan of Study to the CS Graduate Advisor by the end of the second
term after the student’s formal admission to the program. Part-time students
should submit their initial plan after completing 9 credits in the program.
Approval from the CS Graduate Advisor will indicate an acceptable outline of the
student’s coursework. However, the plan can be revised at any time by mutual
agreement of the student and the CS Graduate Advisor. A final version of a
student’s Plan of Study should be submitted by the student’s last term of the
program.<br><br>Students completing an <a
href="#4-4-thesis-option">M.S. thesis</a> are required to have a faculty adviser
who supervises their research on the thesis topic and chairs their thesis
committee. The CS Graduate Advisor remains responsible for monitoring the
student’s overall progress towards the degree.
</p>
<h3 id="4-4-thesis-option">4.4 Thesis Option</h3>
<p>
The thesis option gives M.S. students the opportunity to obtain training and
experience in doing research about a specialized topic in Computer Science. It
involves doing independent work to define, investigate, and report on a research
topic, under supervision of a faculty advisor. Research work typically extends
over several terms, and culminates in writing a thesis and giving an oral
presentation about it (the “defense”).
</p>
<p>
Doing a thesis is an excellent way to explore a particular topic in depth, and
to learn what the research process is like. Students interested in continuing on
to obtain a Ph.D. are particularly encouraged to consider doing a thesis, since
many Ph.D. programs look for research experience when making admissions
decisions.
</p>
<p>
Students considering the thesis option should start looking for a suitable
research topic and advisor no later than their third full-time term (after 18
credits). It is the student’s responsibility to identify a faculty member who is
willing to advise them. Faculty are typically most willing to advise a student
who has taken a class with them or whose interests overlap their research
expertise.
</p>
<p>
The thesis option requires enrolling for 6-9 credits of CS 503 (Thesis), which
count towards the required 45 credits for the M.S. Realistically, the amount of
time and work required to complete the thesis may be greater than required for
6-9 ordinary course credits. The <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/how-register#By-Arrangement">By
Arrangement Approval Dashboard</a> can be used to register for CS 503 credits
(see <a href="#11-2-by-arrangement-courses">here</a> for more details). CS 503
is normally graded Pass/No Pass, but the grade is assigned only when the thesis
defense is completed; until then the grade will show as In Progress (IP).
</p>
<p>
Students must follow PSU policies regarding thesis committee appointments,
defense procedures, formatting requirements, and submission procedures.
University requirements and additional information for a<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/thesis-and-dissertation-information">
master’s thesis</a> are outlined by the PSU Graduate School.
</p>
<p>
A thesis defense must take place in a meeting with the student and the appointed
committee. It should be scheduled on a date that meets the<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/graduate-candidate-deadlines"> GS
deadline</a> for the desired graduation term. A room for the thesis defense may
be scheduled through the CS department (csoffice@pdx.edu). Thesis students will
need to send their abstract and other required information and any requested
equipment (e.g., video conferencing camera) at least two weeks in advance of the
defense to the CS Graduate Advisor (<a
href="mailto:gccs@pdx.edu">gccs@pdx.edu</a>).
</p>
<h3 id="4-5-course-load">4.5 Course Load</h3>
<ul>
<li>Full-time enrollment is 3 courses (at least 9 credits) per term.</li>
<li>Students taking fewer than 9 credits are considered part-time.</li>
<li>International students must normally take a minimum of at least 9 credits
per term to maintain their status, but there are some exceptions. Information
and help on this topic may be found<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/enrollment"> here</a>.</li>
<li>Teaching and research assistants are normally required to complete at least
9 graduate credits each quarter with a grade of B- or better, or a Pass;
however, students completing the final two terms of their degree need only
enroll for 5 graduate credits.
<li> Approval is required to register in 11 credits or
more during a given term. To request this, complete the<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/forms"> Overload Approval form</a> and
submit it to the CS Graduate Advisor. </li>
<li>If a student is unable to register for any coursework during a given term,
it is their responsibility to inform the CS Graduate Advisor and the Office of
Graduate Studies. For details, see the sections on <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/current/bulletin/graduate-school/enrollment/leave-of-absence/">Leave
of Absence </a>or <a

in the PSU Bulletin. </li>
<li>All coursework applied to the master’s program must be completed within the
seven years prior to the awarding of the degree. For example, a course taken in
Fall 2025 will be beyond the seven-year limit after Fall 2032. So, a student
would need to graduate in Fall 2032 at the latest to include a Fall 2025
course.</li>

<h3 id="4-6-cs-505-reading-&-conference-and-cs-506-special-project-credits">4.6
CS 505 (Reading & Conference) and CS 506 (Special Project) Credits</h3>
<p>
Students who are interested in exploring a specific topic or conducting a
special research or other project for credit have the option to register for
CS<strong> 505 (Reading & Conference)</strong> and/or <strong>CS 506 (Special
Project)</strong> credits. A maximum of 6 credits of CS 505 and CS 506 can be
counted towards the CS Master’s degree elective requirements.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CS 505 Reading & Conference: the student will study a textbook on a
particular topic; complete the end of chapter problems; and discuss/present
their chapter summaries, exercise solutions, and other content with the
supervising faculty member.</li>
<li>CS 506 Special Project: the student will gather and analyze data or research
an agreed topic and write up their results in a presentable format under the
guidance of the supervising faculty member.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Students first need to find a faculty member to supervise these credits. The
faculty member can help the student to develop their idea, to ensure that it is
consistent with the academic goals of the program, and to determine the
appropriate course number, credit number, and project scope. They will assign
the final grade at the end of the term. CS505/506 credits are normally graded
Pass/NoPass, but the student and faculty member may choose to use letter grading
instead.
</p>
<p>
The<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/how-register#By-Arrangement"> By
Arrangement Approval Dashboard</a> can be used to register for CS 505/506
credits. A brief but meaningful description of the intended work is required.
Either the student or the faculty member can initiate a request, and once both
have approved it, the request is automatically forwarded to the Department for
approval and then to the Registrar’s Office for processing.
</p>
<h3 id="4-7-pre-admission-transfer-and-non-cs-credits">4.7 Pre-admission,
Transfer, and Non-CS Credits</h3>
<p>
A minimum of 30 credits must be taken in Computer Science at Portland State
University. Given this, students may use a combined total of 15 pre-admission,
transfer, and non-CS credits toward their Master’s degree with CS Graduate
Advisor approval (gccs@pdx.edu). One additional credit beyond the 15 credit
limit can be used provided none of the courses is a 1-credit course.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-admission credits</strong> (taken before the term of formal
graduate admission at PSU) can include both transfer and PSU credits.
Pre-admission credits taken at PSU are requested via a DARS exception submitted
to the Graduate School by the CS Graduate Advisor. This request should be made
soon after admission to the graduate program.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer credits</strong> refer to credits taken from another
institution other than PSU. To request approval of transfer credits, the student
should complete and submit the<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/forms">
GO-21M form (Proposed Transfer Credit)</a> and M.S. <a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/MS-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">Plan 
of Study form</a>, along with course syllabi for the proposed transfer credit to
the CS Graduate Advisor. Students should submit the GO-21M form during the first
term of enrollment in the program, so there is sufficient time to complete any
additional coursework that may be necessary. Any transfer credits must be
approved before graduation paperwork can be processed. <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/joint-campus-registration">OHSU joint
campus credits</a> appear on the PSU transcript, but are considered transfer
credits and must be listed on the GO-21M. </li>
<li><strong>Non-CS credits</strong> taken outside of Computer Science can count
towards elective requirements with approval of the CS Graduate Advisor. Non-CS
courses must be graduate level. Courses from Math or ECE are routinely approved;
courses from other departments must be relevant to the student’s M.S. program.
All Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) courses are approved, but at
most 4 ETM credits (normally one course) can be counted towards the CS M.S.
<p>
    To determine whether a non-CS course can count, the student should first
check with the Graduate Advisor to see if the course has been approved in the
past. If the course has not already been approved, the student should submit the
following information to the Graduate Advisor, who will pass it to the CS
graduate committee for review:
</p></li>
<ul>
<li>Course information. Title, description, syllabus, and other materials that
may help the evaluation.</li>
<li>A rationale that explains why this course is relevant to the CS degree.</li>
<li>An up to date M.S. Plan of Study that incorporates the non-CS course. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate is designed to prepare students for
computing industry careers that require broad and deep advanced knowledge of
cybersecurity principles and practices. It may be pursued either as a standalone
program or in parallel with an M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Computer Science. In the
latter case, obtaining the Certificate is a way to establish a visible
transcript credential in the cybersecurity field, thus going beyond the M.S.
Security track, which is not notated on the transcript.
</p>
<p>
The Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate program requires <a
href="#2-admissions">admission</a> as a graduate student in Computer Science.
The program requires 21 total hours of graduate classes. There are two core
classes for a total of 6 hours. In addition, five elective classes must be taken
for the needed additional 15 credit hours.
</p>
<h3 id="5-1-procedure">5.1 Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>The student must first gain admission to the Graduate CS Program as either
an M.S. or Ph.D. candidate. Note that an M.S. candidate may choose to either get
both an M.S. and the Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate, or just complete the
Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate.</li>
<li>Then the student must add the Cybersecurity Certificate by filling out the
<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/forms">GO-19 form</a>. Within the form,
the student should select “ADD” to include the certificate with their current
graduate degree program or “Transfer to” to pursue the certificate on its own.

Many graduates with degrees in fields other than Computer Science are interested
in pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science. The Graduate Preparation (or "Grad
Prep") Track can assist a high performing, motivated student in mastering the
essential computer science core necessary to be successful in the Master's
program. The Grad Prep Track consists of a Programming & Languages Core and a
Theory Core, comprised of many of the same classes taken by undergraduate
Computer Science majors. For some of these courses, there is an option to test
out by demonstrating mastery based on either prior academic preparation or
professional/personal programming experience through a credit by exam process.

</p>
<h3 id="6-2-admission-to-psu">6.2 Admission to PSU</h3>
<p>
To begin Grad Prep at PSU, prospective students must first apply for<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/admissions/postbaccalaureate"> postbaccalaureate
admission</a>. Postbaccalaureate applications are processed as they are
received, generally within 4-6 weeks.
</p>
<h3 id="6-3-sample-schedules">6.3 Sample Schedules</h3>
<p>
Students who did not take math beyond pre-calculus in their prior coursework are
strongly advised to take at least one such course (e.g. calculus, linear
algebra, discrete math, etc.) prior to taking CS 250.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This<a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/Grad-Prep-Modest-Schedule.pdf">
sample program</a> assumes the student has modest programming experience and an
adequate mathematical background. </li>
<li>This<a

sample program</a> assumes the student has no prior programming
experience and a limited mathematical background.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-4-frequently-asked-questions">6.4 Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is the admission process to the graduate CS program
selective?<br></strong>In general, yes, but not for Grad Prep students.
At this time, all students who successfully complete Grad Prep who also meet the
basic graduate admission requirements are admitted to the CS graduate
program.</li>
<li><strong>Can Grad Prep courses be in progress when the graduate application
is submitted?<br></strong>Yes. In this case, the student is admitted
conditionally to the graduate program, meaning, on the condition that they
receive a passing grade for all in progress courses. If the in-progress
coursework is not completed with the appropriate grade by the end of the term,
graduate admission will be deferred to a future term until all Grad Prep courses
have been successfully completed.</li>
<li><strong>Can Grad Prep coursework be taken at a community college?</strong>
Yes. The 100-200 level Grad Prep courses, and any necessary math courses,
can be completed at one of the community colleges listed here: <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/transfer-guides">https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/transfer-guides</a>.
Coursework offered at institutions that are not on this list need to be
evaluated. To initiate this evaluation, send a course syllabus to the CS
Graduate Advisor ahead of enrolling in the course. If the course has already
been completed, also include an unofficial transcript.
</li>
<li><strong>Can a student register in their next Grad Prep class at PSU when
their last community college course is still in progress?
<br></strong>Yes. The student must submit a current unofficial transcript
from the college that shows the course in progress to the CS Graduate Advisor.
Once the grade has been recorded for the class, the student will need to send an
updated unofficial transcript to the CS Graduate Advisor in order to demonstrate
that they have met the prerequisite requirement for the PSU class. They will
also need to submit an official transcript to PSU Admissions so the course can
be officially transferred to PSU.</li>
<li><strong>Once the student is admitted to the CS graduate program, will
tuition increase? <br></strong>Yes. Details of tuition and fees are
located on the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/student-finance/tuition">Student
Finance page</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="7-doctoral-degree-ph-d">7 Doctoral Degree (Ph.D.)</h2>
<p>
The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is the highest degree offered in the Computer
Science discipline. It is intended for those who will pursue research in the
field. The degree is usually required to teach Computer Science at the
university level, and for employment in prestigious industrial research
laboratories. Students may enter the doctoral program with a bachelor's degree
or with a master's degree, provided they have adequate background in Computer
Science. Since completion of the degree requires presentation of a dissertation
comprising of original research, the time required is not completely
predictable. Four to six years of full-time work are typical, less if the
student enters with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Part-time pursuit of
the degree is also possible.
</p>
<p>
The requirements for the Ph.D. include core and elective coursework, passing a
Research Proficiency Examination, writing and defending a Dissertation Proposal,
and completing and defending the Dissertation itself. Throughout, the focus of
the program is strongly on research.
</p>
<h3 id="7-1-stages-of-the-program">7.1 Stages of the Program</h3>
<p>
Students progress through the Ph.D. program in a sequence of three stages, each
with its own focus, advising structure, time constraints, and requirements for
completion. The three stages are described below. See also the Graduate School’s
<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/summary-of-procedures-doctoral-degrees">Summary
of Ph.D. procedures</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="7-1-1-coursework-and-preliminary-research">7.1.1 Coursework and
preliminary research</h4>
<p>
During this stage, the student completes coursework, in particular a set of Core
courses intended to develop breadth of exposure to CS, and simultaneously begins
to do direct research.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This stage culminates in the Research Proficiency Exam (RPE), which is the
CS department’s version of the Comprehensive Exam required by the university.
</li>
<li>In addition, the student should have completed most or all of the Core
course requirement by the time they take the RPE. In particular, it is
recommended that students take CS669 Scholarship Skills in the term before they
take the RPE. </li>
<li>The remainder of a full-time program during this stage will be filled with
electives, typically including CS601 Research courses.</li>
<li>The student will normally fulfill the university’s <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/current/bulletin/graduate-school/enrollment/residency-requirements/">residency
requirement</a> during this stage.</li>
<li>During this stage, the student has a faculty advisor (ultimately their RPE
advisor) and an advisory committee. In addition, an RPE committee is formed
towards the end of this stage for the specific purpose of the RPE exam.</li>
<li>This stage normally takes about two years of full-time study to complete.
The normal deadline for completing the RPE is at the end of a student's second
year or their sixth term. Students who enter with an M.S. degree and have
already taken much of their coursework may be able to complete this stage in one
year. (The Graduate School allows 5-7 years to pass the Comprehensive exam, but
the department’s requirement is much stricter.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7-1-2-focused-research-and-dissertation-definition">7.1.2 Focused
research and dissertation definition</h4>
<p>
During this stage, the student confirms their choice of research advisor and
focuses on finding and refining a topic for their dissertation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This stage culminates in the preparation of the Dissertation Proposal and
its formal oral defense. In the university’s terminology, completing this stage
means the student has Advanced to Candidacy.</li>
<li>Students must also finish any remaining coursework (excluding CS 603
Dissertation credits) during this stage. In particular, no student will be
allowed to advance to candidacy without having completed the Core Courses with
satisfactory grades. All elective course credits (including CS 601 Research
credits) must also be completed. </li>
<li>During this stage, the student works primarily with their Research Advisor.
The Research Advisor is normally the RPE advisor, but a change at the beginning
of this stage is still possible. The original Advisory Committee also remains
active. Before the Proposal can be defended, the Dissertation Committee must be
formed. </li>
<li>This stage typically takes one to three years of full-time study. The
university enforces a three year maximum time limit between passing the RPE
(Comprehensive examination) and advancing to candidacy. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7-1-3-dissertation-completion">7.1.3 Dissertation completion</h4>
<p>
During this stage, the student is focused entirely on completing research and
writing for the Dissertation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This stage culminates with the completion of the Dissertation and its formal
oral defense, followed by awarding of the degree.</li>
<li>During this stage, the student works under supervision of the Research
Advisor and with the input of the Dissertation Committee. When the student
advances to candidacy, the original Advisory Committee is dissolved and its role
is taken over by the Dissertation Committee.</li>
<li>The student’s course load during this stage normally consists solely of CS
603 or CS603C Dissertation credits. Occasionally, the student may carry other
credits, e.g. if the student has an internship that requires them to register
for CS 604 Internship credits. </li>
<li>This stage typically takes one to three years. The university requires a
minimum of four months, and a maximum of five years to elapse between
advancement to candidacy and completion of all degree requirements including the
dissertation and its defense.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-2-ph-d-advising">7.2 Ph.D. Advising</h3>
<p>
The advising structure for the Ph.D. involves a number of different faculty
roles and committees, which change as the student advances through the stages of
the program.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>CS Graduate Advisor</strong> (<a
href="mailto:gccs@pdx.edu">gccs@pdx.edu</a>) is the staff member responsible for
administering the Ph.D. rules, tracking completion of requirements, and
providing an interface to the Graduate School. For Ph.D. students, the Graduate
Advisor does not generally perform academic advising, e.g. about what courses to
take or which research topics to pursue; this is the role of their
<strong>Faculty Advisor</strong> and various faculty committees, as described
below. However, the Graduate Advisor remains a crucial point of contact for
students. In particular, the Graduate Advisor makes sure that each student has a
current <a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/PhD-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">Ph.D. 
Plan of Study form</a> on file.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Faculty Advisor (FA). </strong>Responsibility for academic and research
supervision rests with the Faculty Advisor. Students are assigned an initial FA
upon entry to the Ph.D. program. The FA provides guidance on all academic
aspects of the Ph.D. program, and approves the courses in the student’s program,
including non-CS courses and courses taken outside of PSU. Normally, the FA also
supervises the student’s research activities as appropriate to their program
stage. FAs must be regular, full-time, tenured or tenure-track, assistant
professor or higher in rank faculty members in Computer Science (including
Affiliate Faculty) who hold a Ph.D. and are engaged in research.
</p>
<p>
It is not uncommon for a student to change FAs during their program, e.g. if
their area of interest shifts or as they get to know other faculty in the
department. Any change must be properly recorded and documented by the CS
Graduate Advisor. Note that the old and new FAs must agree to the change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Choosing an advisor.</strong> Some useful advice on picking an advisor
can be found <a
href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/hh9cxnuvluxgmm9lebbpgrrralc89bhc">here</a> and
<a
href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Get-Advisor.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Initial Faculty Advisor</strong>. The initial FA will usually be a
faculty member who works in the student’s intended area of specialization;
often, it will be someone the student has already been in contact with prior to
admission. If the incoming student is being supported directly by a faculty
research grant, that faculty member will be the FA.
</p>
<p>
The role of the initial FA is to help the student plan and execute their program
of study for the first few terms of the degree. The FA and the student should
meet regularly. The student and FA will fill out a<a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/PhD-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">
Ph.D. Plan of Study form</a><strong> </strong>after the student successfully
completes 9 graduate level credits, no later than 6 months before their<a
href="#7-8-research-proficiency-examination-comprehensive-examination"> Research
Proficiency Exam (RPE)</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the initial FA works in the student’s area of specialization, they will
typically also discuss potential research projects and topics; otherwise, the
initial FA will help try to connect the student to other faculty members who
might be able to supervise their research and become their FA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Advisory Committee</strong>. Ph.D. students must have an Advisory
Committee (AC) by the end of their second term, consisting of their FA plus two
additional faculty members, who should be CS faculty but <strong>not</strong>
necessarily in the student’s research area. The role of the AC is to monitor the
student’s progress, to offer academic guidance, and to provide a resource in
resolving academic or advising issues, especially if the student is
uncomfortable discussing an issue with their FA.
</p>
<p>
The AC is formed by the student in consultation with the FA, and is recorded in
the <a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/PhD-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">Ph.D. 
Plan of Study form</a>.
</p>
<p>
The AC will meet with the student in the Fall and Spring terms to generate a
written assessment of progress and to set goals in writing for the next term.
</p>
<p>
The AC, in consultation with the CS Director of Graduate Studies, has the
authority to delay a student’s RPE date.
</p>
<p>
The committee's opinion shall have strong weight in determining whether the
student should continue to receive departmental support in the form of a
teaching assistantship.
</p>
<p>
The advisory committee's role is taken over by the Dissertation Committee when
the student advances to candidacy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>RPE Advisor</strong>. In order to take the <a
href="#7-8-research-proficiency-examination-comprehensive-examination">Research
Proficiency Exam</a> and enter the research-focused stage of their program, the
student must find a faculty member who is willing to supervise their RPE
research. This might be initial FA, but may be someone else, in which case the
student should officially change FAs by contacting the Graduate Advisor after
obtaining permission of old and new FAs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>RPE Committee. </strong>Once the student has an RPE advisor and topic,
they need to form a 3-person RPE committee (which is not the same thing as the
AC). The role of the RPE Committee is to sit in judgement on the RPE paper and
defense. Committee members will normally be CS faculty members who hold a Ph.D.
and are knowledgeable in the research area of the RPE topic. For more details on
RPE Committee makeup, see <a
href="#7-8-research-proficiency-examination-comprehensive-examination">Research
Proficiency Exam</a>. Note that the RPE committee does <em>not</em> supercede
the AC, which remains in place.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dissertation Advisor.</strong> After the student passes the RPE, they
begin focusing on research with the goal of choosing a dissertation topic, and
writing and defending the Dissertation Proposal. To formally propose a
dissertation, the student must have a FA who is willing to supervise the
dissertation research. Typically, this will be the RPE advisor, but advisor
changes at this stage do sometimes occur; again, the student should officially
change advisors by contacting the Graduate Advisor after obtaining permission of
old and new FAs. Note that the dissertation advisor is also responsible for
signing off on the student’s final Program of Study at graduation, including all
coursework.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dissertation Committee</strong>. The dissertation committee passes
judgement on the dissertation proposal and on the final dissertation itself. It
is chaired by the Dissertation Advisor and consists of four to six faculty
members who are experts in the topic of the dissertation. See <a
href="#7-9-dissertation-proposal-and-committee">Dissertation Proposal</a> for
more details on the makeup of this committee. The Dissertation Committee
replaces the CS Advisory Committee as a source for general academic advice.
</p>
<h3 id="7-3-curriculum">7.3 Curriculum</h3>
<p>
The Ph.D. program requires the following courses and credits.
</p>
<h4 id="7-3-1-core-courses-18-credits">7.3.1 Core Courses (18 credits)</h4>
<ul>
<li>CS 669 Scholarship Skills for Computer Science & Engineering (3

</p>
<ul>
<li>A maximum of 18 credits of <a
href="#7-7-by-arrangement-courses-cs-601-602-603-605-606">CS 501/601 (Research)
</a>may be counted. These credits are typically used for research conducted

</ul>
<h4 id="7-3-4-cs-603-dissertation-credits-27-credits">7.3.4 CS 603 Dissertation
Credits (27 credits)</h4>
<p>
These credits are used to cover work on the dissertation, both before and after
the student has advanced to candidacy, i.e., has an approved dissertation
proposal. Prior to advancement to candidacy, dissertation research can be
covered by CS 603 credits or by CS 601 Research credits. Once the student has
taken the maximum of 18 CS 601 credits that count towards their elective
requirement, and is actively working on their dissertation, they should normally
switch to using CS 603 credits. After advancement to candidacy, all research
credits should be CS 603.
</p>
<p>
Once the student has advanced to candidacy <strong>and</strong> completed 27
credits of CS 603, they are eligible to enroll in CS 603C at a greatly reduced
tuition cost ($10/credit + mandatory fees). This is particularly valuable for
students who need to maintain a full-time course load. All students must remain
enrolled for at least one credit per term after advancing to candidacy. See this

<li>Students <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/bulletin/graduate-school/enrollment/minimum-enrollment/">must
be enrolled</a> for at least one credit in every term (excluding summer) in
which they are involved in activities requiring faculty time or university
facilities. In particular, students must be registered for a minimum of 1
graduate credit during the terms in which they complete the RPE (comprehensive

requirement</a>. This is assessed after the student completes the RPE and it can
be satisfied in one of the following ways: </li>
<li>Three terms of full-time enrollment (minimum 9 graduate credits) during the
first two years after admission (may include one or more summer terms).</li>
<li>Six terms of part-time enrollment (minimum 1 graduate credit) during the
first two years after admission to the program (may include one or more summer
terms).</li>
<li>A doctoral student who was enrolled in the CS M.S. program at PSU, and whose
matriculation to the doctoral program immediately follows (within one calendar
year) the master's degree program may fulfill the residency requirement during
the period in which the student was enrolled in the master's program.</li>
<li>If a student is unable to register for any coursework during a given term,
it is their responsibility to inform their Faculty Advisor, the CS Graduate
Advisor and the Office of Graduate Studies. For details, see the sections on <a

<h3 id="7-6-timetable-for-part-time-students">7.6 Timetable for Part-time
Students</h3>
<p>
Some Ph.D. students work towards the degree on a part-time basis, which
naturally lengthens the time needed to complete the three stages. In general,
the department tries to be flexible in accommodating students by relaxing
deadlines, e.g. for the RPE exam. However, students should be aware that the
University and Graduate Schools time limits and requirements for continuous
enrollment are <strong>not </strong>relaxed for part-time students, although
requests for exceptions to the rules (made by <a
href="#11-5-petitions">petition</a>) may be viewed favorably by the Graduate
School.
</p>
<h3 id="7-7-by-arrangement-courses-cs-601-602-603-605-606">7.7 By Arrangement
Courses (CS 601/602/603/605/606)</h3>
<p>
Ph.D. students will typically register for <strong>CS 601 (Research)</strong>
with their research advisor to obtain credit for their work preparing for the
RPE and the Dissertation Proposal. A maximum of 18 credits of CS 601 can be
applied to the Ph.D. Elective Course requirement, but it is common to take
additional CS 601 credits to remain in full-time status as an GA and/or
international student.
</p>
<p>
Students may register for <strong>CS 602 (Independent Study)</strong>,
<strong>CS 605 (Reading & Conference)</strong> or <strong>CS 606 (Special
Project)</strong> credits with their advisor or another faculty member who is
relevant to their research. A maximum of 6 credits of CS 602/605/606 can be
counted towards the Ph.D. elective course requirement.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CS 601 Research: the student will conduct research under the guidance of the
supervising faculty member.</li>
<li>CS 602 Independent Study: the student will define and study a topic that is
not covered by an existing CS course under the guidance of the supervising
faculty member. </li>
<li>CS 603 Dissertation credits are discussed <a
href="#7-3-4-cs-603-dissertation-credits-27-credits">here</a>.</li>
<li>CS 605 Reading & Conference: the student will study a textbook on a
particular topic; complete the end of chapter problems; and discuss/present
their chapter summaries, exercise solutions, and other content with the
supervising faculty member.</li>
<li>CS 606 Special Project: the student will gather and analyze data or research
an agreed topic and write up their results in a presentable format under the
guidance of the supervising faculty member.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Students first need to find a faculty member to supervise these credits. The
faculty member can help the student to develop their idea, to ensure that it is
consistent with the academic goals of the program, and to determine the
appropriate course number, credit number, and project scope. They will assign
the final grade at the end of the term. By Arrangement credits are normally
graded Pass/NoPass, but the student and faculty member may choose to use letter
grading instead.
</p>
<p>
The<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/how-register#By-Arrangement"> By
Arrangement Approval Dashboard</a> is used to register for CS
601/602/603/605/606 credits. A brief but meaningful description of the intended
work is required. Either the student or the faculty member can initiate a
request, and once both have approved it, the request is automatically forwarded
to the Department for approval and then to the Registrar’s Office for
processing.
</p>
<p>
Note: CS 501/502/505/506 can be used interchangeably with CS 601/602/605/606.
</p>
<h3 id="7-8-research-proficiency-examination-comprehensive-examination">7.8
Research Proficiency Examination (Comprehensive Examination)</h3>
<p>
The comprehensive exam is a university requirement for the doctoral degree. In
the CS Department, it takes the form of the Research Proficiency Examination
(RPE), covering original research performed by the student and assessing their
preparation within the chosen research area. The exam consists of a written
paper, public oral presentation, and a public question and answer session.
Passing the exam is required before a Ph.D. student can prepare and defend a
dissertation proposal.
</p>
<p>
Each Ph.D. student must have an RPE Advisor, who has agreed to supervise their
RPE research. It is the student’s responsibility to identify an RPE Advisor in a
timely manner.
</p>
<p>
The RPE will be judged by a 3-person RPE Committee consisting of the RPE Advisor
and two other faculty members. (Note: The RPE Committee is <strong>not</strong>
the same thing as the student’s Advisory Committee). Committee members are
invited to serve by the RPE advisor. Each committee member must formally agree
to serve, after being informed of the topic of the RPE. The committee must be
approved by the CS Director of Graduate Studies. Committee membership and
approval must be communicated to the CS Graduate Advisor using the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/g/files/znldhr1671/files/2020-07/RPE-Check-List.pdf">RPE
Checklist</a> .
</p>
<p>
RPE committee members will normally be CS faculty members who hold a Ph.D. and
are knowledgeable in the research area. Other suitably qualified persons (e.g.
faculty from adjacent fields, other departments or institutions, or industry
experts) may serve, with the approval of the CS Director of Graduate Studies.
</p>
<p>
The RPE exam consists of a written research paper and an oral presentation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ph.D. student conducts research on a problem and writes a paper that is
in a form appropriate for publication at a conference or workshop in that
research area. Standard formatting can be used as appropriate for that
area.</li>
<li>The student schedules the RPE presentation with the RPE committee.
Presentations can take place at any time during the academic year, and do not
need to be coordinated with each other.</li>
<li>The presentation is open to all. An announcement of the presentation and a
copy (or pointer to) the paper must be circulated to the full faculty a week
before the presentation.</li>
<li>The presentation is 45 minutes for the talk followed by 15 minutes for
questions. The format is that of a typical technical talk that first motivates
the problem, then describes related work, followed by the research
contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The RPE committee assesses the two components of the exam (paper and oral
presentation) independently. For each component, the committee chooses one of
the following outcomes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass. This outcome requires unanimous agreement by the RPE committee.</li>
<li>Retake. The student needs to address the committee's feedback and retake
this component of the exam within six months. Only one retake of each component
is allowed.</li>
<li>Fail, without the possibility of a further retake.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Timing considerations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The RPE must normally be attempted by the end of the student’s second year
at PSU, counting from the term in which the student enters the Ph.D.
program.</li>
<li>Extensions to the two-year period may be granted by a Ph.D. student's
advisory committee in consultation with the CS director of graduate
studies.</li>
<li>Part-time students may routinely obtain an extension to three years. Note:
the university limit is 5 years if entering with a M.S. degree and 7 years
otherwise.</li>
<li>Students must be registered for a minimum of 1 graduate credit in each term
they are taking or preparing for the RPE.</li>

<h3 id="7-9-dissertation-proposal-and-committee">7.9 Dissertation Proposal and
Committee</h3>
<p>
After passing the RPE (comprehensive exam) and identifying a dissertation
research topic, the student proceeds to develop, write and defend a Dissertation
Proposal, under the guidance of their Faculty Advisor. This section describes
key aspects of the proposal; consult the Graduate School’s detailed <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/bulletin/graduate-school/degree-requirements/doctoral-degree/dissertation-proposal/">Dissertation
Proposal</a> rules for further information.
</p>
<p>
The dissertation proposal:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifies the general research field (e.g. networks) and presents an
annotated bibliography of literature relevant to the particular dissertation
topic (e.g. verification of network routing protocols).</li>
<li>Describes the research problem.</li>
<li>Describes the proposed approach to solving the problem, including specific
methods to be tried.</li>
<li>Gives a timeline for completing the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The dissertation proposal and eventual dissertation are judged by the student’s
Ph.D. Dissertation Committee. This committee is proposed by the student and
their Faculty Advisor using the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/forms">GO-16</a> form, and must be approved
by the CS Director of Graduate Studies and by the Graduate School. Ph.D.
dissertation committees must consist of at least four and not more than six
faculty members. The Dissertation Advisor is chair of the dissertation
committee, and must be a regular, full-time PSU instructional faculty member,
tenured or tenure track, assistant professor or higher in rank. The other three
to five committee members may include non-tenure track or adjunct faculty and/or
members of the OHSU faculty. At least one of the committee members must be from
Computer Science; the others may be from Computer Science or may be PSU faculty
from another department or OHSU faculty. If it is necessary to go off campus for
a committee member with specific expertise not available among PSU faculty, a CV
for that proposed member must be submitted with the GO-16 form; this off-campus
member may substitute for one of the three to five regular committee members.
Members with a courtesy appointment will count as PSU faculty members in terms
of determining PSU vs. off-campus membership, but the majority of the committee
members must be PSU employees. All committee members must have doctoral degrees.
</p>
<p>
No proposal defense shall be valid without a dissertation committee approved by
the Graduate School. The GO-16 form should be submitted to the Graduate School a
minimum of six weeks in advance of the estimated date of the dissertation
proposal meeting. The student must deliver a draft of the dissertation proposal
to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the
proposal defense. The abstract and date for the defense must be submitted to the
CS Graduate Advisor at least two weeks in advance of the date of the defense.
Upon satisfactory agreement, the student will publicly present and defend the
proposal. The presentation begins with an oral talk, after which the
dissertation committee will question the student privately.
</p>
<p>
If the Proposal Defense is successful, the student is advanced to candidacy upon
Graduate School approval of the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/forms">GO-23</a> form submitted by the CS
department.
</p>
<h3 id="7-10-dissertation-completion-and-defense">7.10 Dissertation Completion
and Defense</h3>
<p>
Under the direction and consultation of the dissertation committee, Ph.D.
candidates must complete a dissertation consisting of original research. The
student will prepare, revise, and correct a draft of the dissertation as
directed by the dissertation committee until it meets their approval. The work
is expected to be of a quality to merit publication in refereed journals or
conferences.
</p>
<p>
After preparation of the written dissertation, a candidate’s dissertation
committee will conduct a dissertation defense. Detailed Graduate School
requirements on the timing and conduct of the Dissertation Defense may be found
<a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/bulletin/graduate-school/degree-requirements/doctoral-degree/dissertation-defense/">here</a>.
The candidate is expected to prepare an oral presentation on the research

</ul>
<h3 id="7-12-transferring-coursework">7.12 Transferring coursework</h3>
<p>
Students may transfer coursework from other institutions to meet some course
requirements for the Ph.D. In particular, students who already have an M.S.
degree in Computer Science can typically meet most course requirements in this
way.
</p>
<p>
All transfer courses must be approved by the CS department and the Graduate
School. To request credit, the student should fill out a <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/forms">GO-21D form (Proposed Transfer
Credit)</a> in consultation with their advisor and submit it to the CS Graduate
Advisor. Students should submit the GO-21D form during the first term of
enrollment in the program, so there is sufficient time to complete any
additional coursework that may be necessary. Any transfer credits must be
approved before the student advances to candidacy.
</p>
<p>
All transfer courses must ordinarily be in Computer Science (but see <a
href="#7-14-non-cs-courses">Non-CS courses</a>, below). They must have been
taken for a letter grade, and received a grade of B or better. There is no
particular limit on how long ago the course was taken.
</p>
<p>
Approved transfer courses may be applied without limitation towards the Elective
Courses requirement (up to 45 credits).
</p>
<p>
An approved transfer course may be applied towards the Core Requirements only if
its content closely matches that of a PSU course on the list of approved Core
courses. The determination of whether the course matches will be made by the
Course Advisor for the PSU course.
</p>
<p>
The student should be prepared to provide a syllabus or other description of the
proposed transfer course if requested. The grade on the transferred course will
be used when checking the minimum grading requirements for Core courses.
</p>
<p>
In rare cases, a student who transfers in most or all of their CS course
requirements may have to take additional course credits in order to meet the
university’s <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/bulletin/graduate-school/degree-requirements/doctoral-degree/residency-requirement/">residency
requirement</a> for the Ph.D.
</p>
<h3 id="7-13-pre-admission-credits">7.13 Pre-Admission Credits</h3>
<p>
Courses taken at PSU prior to formal admission to the Ph.D. program can be used
to meet Ph.D. course requirements with approval by the faculty advisor via the
Ph.D. Plan of Study. The student must submit the signed plan to the CS Graduate
Advisor to prompt a DARS adjustment.
</p>
<h3 id="7-14-non-cs-courses">7.14 Non-CS Courses</h3>
<p>
Courses from fields other than Computer Science, including transfer courses, can
be applied to the Elective Course requirement with permission of the student’s
advisor. This should be documented in the student’s Program of Study.
</p>
<p>
Using <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/joint-campus-registration">OHSU

<h2 id="8-combining-master’s-&-doctoral-degrees">8 Combining Master’s & Doctoral
Degrees</h2>
<p>
It is not uncommon for students in the M.S. program to enter the Ph.D. program
directly after obtaining their M.S. degree, or transfer to the Ph.D. program
even before receiving their M.S. degree. Conversely, Ph.D. students sometimes
wish to obtain an M.S. degree if they leave the Ph.D. program early, or as an
intermediate credential while they continue working towards the doctorate.
</p>
<p>
Formally, the M.S. and Ph.D. programs are separate, and transferring from one
program to another or adding an additional program on top of an existing one
requires the student to submit the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/request-change-program-go-19-form">GO-19
Request for Change of Program Form</a> with the Graduate School and obtain
permission from the CS department. The CS Graduate Advisor can assist with this
process. Adding or moving to the Ph.D. program from the M.S. requires going
through the usual selective Ph.D. <a
href="#10-1-1-application-process">admission process,</a> but the path can be
eased if the student has a confirmed faculty advisor who advocates for
admission. Adding or moving to the M.S. program from the Ph.D. is normally
permitted without going through an admissions review process.
</p>
<p>
In general, the same coursework can count towards requirements for both degrees.
However, students should be aware of some subtle differences between
requirements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Moving from M.S. to Ph.D.:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum grade that counts towards the M.S. is B-. The minimum grade that
counts towards the Ph.D. is B, and 3 of the 6 core courses must be at least
B+.</li>
<li>Ph.D. students must complete the 6 Core course requirements, including CS669
Scholarship Skills, with at least 3 B+ grades.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Moving from Ph.D. to M.S. (or adding M.S.):</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>CS 501 Research and CS 502 Independent Study courses do not count toward the
M.S.</li>
<li>The Ph.D. allows any number of (approved) pre-admission, transfer, and
non-CS credits, whereas the M.S. limits the total of such courses to 15 credits.
</li>
<li>The M.S. requires Theory and Programming Practice courses and completion of
a 3-course track; while a typical Ph.D. student’s program will satisfy these
requirements, some programs might not.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-graduate-internship-credit">9 Graduate Internship Credit</h2>
<h3 id="9-1-introduction">9.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Portland Metro area offers many opportunities for internships to graduate
students. Many students complete one or more internships with local companies
during their time at PSU. We believe internships provide a valuable training
experience that significantly augments the student’s academic program.
</p>
<p>
While some students choose to participate in an internship without receiving
academic credit, others find it important that they receive academic credit (CS
504 Internship) for their internships, which can count towards CS graduate
degree requirements with approval:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A maximum of 3 internship credits can be counted towards the M.S.
degree.</li>
<li>A maximum of 6 internship credits can be counted towards the Ph.D.
degree.</li>
<li>A maximum of 3 internship credits can be counted per term towards a degree
program (students can register for more internship credits per term, but the
additional credits will not count towards the degree requirements).</li>
<li>Internship credits are graded Pass/No Pass.</li>
<li>The internship credit value per term is determined by the total amount of
time devoted to the internship, which must be documented in the offer
letter:</li>
<ul>
<li>At least 100 hours in a term = 1 credit</li>
<li>At least 200 hours or more in a term = 1-3 credits, at the student’s
option</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
To receive credit for an internship towards their degree program, the student
must meet the eligibility requirements below and submit a request to the
department for approval.
</p>
<h3 id="9-2-eligibility">9.2 Eligibility</h3>
<p>
To be eligible to receive credit for an internship:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A student must have completed at least one term and minimum 9 credits in the
CS graduate (Masters or Ph.D.) program that they are currently enrolled in.</li>
<li>A student must be in<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/academic-standing"> good academic
standing</a> as defined by the University and the CS Department.</li>
<li>A student must have received a job/internship offer letter that describes
the work that they will be doing in sufficient detail to assess its relevance to
the student’s CS degree program.</li>
<li>International students will also have to meet the requirements for<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/curricular-practical-training">
Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a> and must consult with the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/">Office of International
Students and Scholars Services</a> (intl-services@pdx.edu) to check
eligibility.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-3-approval-process">9.3 Approval Process</h3>
<p>
To receive approval for internship credit, the student must complete the
following steps. (Note that these steps must be followed, even if the internship
credit is not being counted towards degree requirements.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1. </strong>Submit the online <a
href="https://forms.gle/VRvVoedLiG95JSVM6">CS Graduate Internship Credit Request
Form</a>. To complete this form, the student will need the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date<a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/MS-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">
M.S. Plan of Study</a> or<a
href="https://web.cs.pdx.edu/files/PhD-Plan-of-Study_Updated%20November%202025.pdf">
Ph.D. Plan of Study</a>.</li>
<li>A copy of the job/internship offer letter containing the job title
description of duties; start and end date (or duration); number of hours per
week; whether the internship will pe in-person, hybrid, or remote; and physical
address where the work will take place (personal or compensation details can be
redacted).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Step 2 (International students only).</strong> Once the student’s
eligibility for <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/curricular-practical-training">Curricular
Practical Training (CPT)</a> is confirmed, they must complete the CPT
application within WorldLink. The student will need to provide their offer
letter, start date, and the contact information for Ella Barrett, Computer
Science Graduate Advisor (<a href="mailto:gccs@pdx.edu">gccs@pdx.edu</a>).

<p>
<strong>Step 3. </strong>Once the relevant steps above are complete, the
internship request will be reviewed. Please allow a few business days for a
response. Incomplete requests will not be processed.
</p>
<h3 id="9-4-registering-for-internship-credits">9.4 Registering for Internship
Credits</h3>
<p>
Upon approval of the internship credit request, and CPT approval (for
international students only), the student will receive instructions for
submitting an online <a href="https://by-arrangement.campus.wdt.pdx.edu/">By
Arrangement form</a> for CS504 Internship, with the approved internship credit
value.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each quarter of the internship, the student must write a
description of what they actually did for the internship, as part of the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/computerscience.web.wdt.pdx.edu/files/2024-10/CS-Internship-Status-Report.pdf">Graduate
Internship Status Report form</a>. After the student completes this form, they
should send it to their supervisor, who will need to review the report, sign the
form, and send it to the Computer Science Graduate Advisor (gccs@pdx.edu) from
their work email address no later than 5pm Friday of finals week for the term.
Failure to submit the status report by the deadline may prevent the student from
receiving a grade or credit for the internship.
</p>
<h3 id="9-5-additional-information-for-international-students">9.5 Additional
Information for International students</h3>
<p>
International students can work at internships (even unpaid ones) only if they
are approved for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). Here are some of the most
important regulations involving CPT:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Student must have completed at least one academic year of full-time study in
the United States (3 consecutive terms, or approximately 9 months)</li>
<li>Student must have F-1 visa status at the time they apply</li>
<li>Student must normally be enrolled full-time (9 credits), if their CPT
happens during a regular academic term (excluding Summer).</li>
<li>Student must be enrolled for at least one internship credit (CS 5/604) even
during Summer term.</li>
<li>Ph.D. students who have advanced to candidacy and are working exclusively on
their dissertation generally only need to carry one internship credit (CS 604)
and one dissertation credit (CS 603/603C) per term.  If the student’s Faculty
Advisor confirms that the internship is directly related to the student’s
dissertation research, then the single dissertation credit may be acceptable in
place of the internship credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Consult <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/curricular-practical-training">Curricular
Practical Training (CPT)</a>  and the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/">Office of International
Students and Scholars Services</a> (<a
href="mailto:intl-services@pdx.edu">intl-services@pdx.edu</a>) for more details
and authoritative information.
</p>
<h2 id="10-graduate-assistantships">10 Graduate Assistantships</h2>
<p>
Computer Science Graduate Assistants (GAs) are graduate students who are hired
to perform instructional, research, or administrative duties for the department.
<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/graduate-assistantships">Graduate
Assistantships</a> are administered in conjunction with the Graduate School, and
are governed by the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/academic-affairs/sites/g/files/znldhr2396/files/2022-12/GEU_CBA_2022-2026_0.pdf">Graduate
Employees Union (GEU) Collective Bargaining Agreement</a>. Both M.S. and Ph.D.
students can serve as GAs, although most available positions are filled by Ph.D.
students.
</p>
<p>
All GAs must be enrolled full-time (except in summer), be in <a
href="https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/bulletin/graduate-school/enrollment/academic-standing/">good
academic standing</a>, and be making satisfactory academic progress. Note that
students completing the final two terms of their degree only need to enroll in a
minimum of 5 graduate credit hours. All GAs receive a full tuition remission and
a fee remission. GAs also receive a monthly stipend, which varies according to
the nature of the appointment, the source of funding, and the student’s stage in
their program.
</p>
<p>
When offered a GA position, the GA will receive a detailed Notice of Appointment
letter that includes the stipend rate and the full-time equivalency (FTE), which
is the percentage of hours the GA will work in a 40-hour work week. For example,
a GA with a 0.37 FTE appointment is expected to work 14.8 hours per week.
</p>
<h3 id="10-1-teaching-assistantships">10.1 Teaching Assistantships</h3>
<p>
A limited number of teaching assistantships (TAs) are available to our
best-qualified graduate students. These assistantships are normally granted for
one term at a time, and are renewable based on department need and the student's
performance in coursework and TA responsibilities. Teaching assistants typically
work with course instructors to hold office hours, grade homework, etc. TAs are
hired with 0.37 FTE appointments (14.8 hours per week) for the quarter.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, a TA may teach a course as Instructor of Record under supervision
of a faculty member. These appointments are for 0.49 FTE (19.6 hours per week).
</p>
<h4 id="10-1-1-application-process">10.1.1 Application Process</h4>
<p>
Students can apply for TA positions on the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/graduate-assistantships">CS graduate
assistantship webpage</a>. Please note that a<a href="https://oam.pdx.edu/"> PSU
Odin account</a> is required to access the application.
</p>
<p>
<strong>	</strong>
</p>
<p>
The selection criteria for teaching assistants are similar to those used for <a
href="#2-admissions">graduate admission</a>: grades, references, plus evidence
of teaching experience or ability.
</p>
<p>
Note that decisions about TA positions are made by the department, not by
individual instructors. While instructors do have some input into the decision
process, it is not generally useful to send unsolicited mail (spam) to
instructors requesting TA positions.
</p>
<h4 id="10-1-2-ta-evaluation-process">10.1.2 TA Evaluation Process</h4>
<p>
At the end of the term, the department will send out a TA evaluation form
seeking feedback from students on overall performance, communication,
accessibility, and knowledge of content. Please note that these evaluations will
be shared with the course instructor, and that poor evaluations can impact a
student's eligibility to be a TA in future terms.
</p>
<h3 id="10-2-research-assistantships">10.2 Research Assistantships</h3>
<p>
Many faculty in the department have research grants that support research
assistants (RAs), who are normally Ph.D. students. Faculty members choose RAs on
an individual basis, but the most important criterion is the student's ability
to contribute to the professor's research program. Typically, students are given
a research assistantship only after they have been in the graduate program for
at least one term and have taken at least one class from the professor, although
faculty do sometimes give RAships to especially qualified incoming students.
Ordinarily, students are able to use the work supported by the assistantship as
part of their own RPE and dissertation research.
</p>
<p>
Stipend rates are set by faculty based on availability of resources. RAs can be
employed at an FTE of 0.30 (12 hours per week) to 0.49 (20 hours per week), or
up to 1.0 (40 hours per week) in summer.
</p>
<h3 id="10-3-hiring-steps">10.3 Hiring Steps</h3>
<p>
GAs must complete hiring paperwork in person at <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/human-resources/">PSU’s Office of Human Resources
(HR)</a> before work can commence. For the list of required documents and more
information, visit: <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/human-resources/new-hire-resources">https://www.pdx.edu/human-resources/new-hire-resources</a>.
New international GAs must also obtain employment authorization from the Office
of International Students & Scholar Services (OISSS). Learn more at: <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/employment">https://www.pdx.edu/international-students/employment</a>.
</p>
<p>
After completing the necessary HR hiring paperwork, the hiring unit or
department will provide the GA with a Notice of Appointment via email with
details of the position, as described in Article 17.3 of the GEU Contract, which
the GA must take action on (accept or deny) to complete the hiring process.
</p>
<h3 id="10-4-tuition-and-fee-remission">10.4 Tuition and Fee Remission</h3>
<p>
The hiring unit or department informs PSU’s Student Finance Office to apply the
tuition and fee remission once the GA accepts their Notice of Appointment, and
enrolls in the necessary 9 credits (or minimum 5 credits, if in the final two
terms of their degree). It is the GA’s responsibility to enroll in the credits
they need by the add/drop deadline for their term of appointment in order for
the tuition and fee remission to be applied. The deadline to register is always
11:59 PM on the Sunday following the first week of the term. Refer to the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/academic-calendar">PSU Academic
Calendar</a> for the exact date.
</p>
<p>
Remissions for GAs who registered by the deadline are submitted in Weeks 1-3 of
the quarter. GAs are never responsible for any late payment fees due to the
remission being applied after the payment deadline for the term. This is written
within Article 20.5 of the GEU contract. The late fee will be reversed once the
remission has been applied.
</p>
<h3 id="10-5-pay-schedule-and-hours">10.5 Pay Schedule and Hours</h3>
<p>
Pay is distributed on the last business day of every month. For more information
about payroll and getting paid, visit:
https://www.pdx.edu/human-resources/payroll.
</p>
<h2 id="11-other-policies-and-procedures">11 Other Policies and Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="11-1-course-numbering">11.1 Course Numbering</h3>
<p>
PSU designates course numbers of the form 5xx as Master’s level and 6xx as Ph.D.
level. However, from a requirements perspective these are usually
interchangeable, so it does not matter which version one takes. (One exception
is that CS 503 applies only to M.S. theses, and CS 603 only to Ph.D.
dissertations.) In fact, the CS department offers very few regularly scheduled
6xx courses except for CS 669 Scholarship Skills. Also, many 5xx courses are
combined with a 4xx version suitable for undergraduate juniors and seniors. In
such cases, the course will normally place additional requirements on students
enrolled at the 5xx level, such as additional learning objectives, an extra
project, etc. It is crucial for graduate students to register in the 5xx version
for the course to count towards graduate degree requirements.
</p>
<h3 id="11-2-by-arrangement-courses">11.2 By Arrangement Courses</h3>
<p>
Course numbers of the form CS 50x and CS 60x are called “by arrangement” – they
do not meet at a regularly scheduled time and place, and are not listed in the
Registration Hub. These courses must be registered for using the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/how-register#By-Arrangement">By
Arrangement Approval Dashboard</a>. Either the student or the faculty member can
initiate a by-approval request, and once both have approved it, the request is
automatically forwarded to the Department for approval and then to the
Registrar’s Office for processing
</p>
<h3 id="11-3-dars-degree-audit-recording-system">11.3 DARS (Degree Audit
Recording System)</h3>
<p>
DARS is an automated system that the university uses to keep track of student
progress towards requirements completion. Students can check their progress by
requesting a DARS audit; see the <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/dars">Graduate School DARS</a> page for
details. Because DARS encoding of requirements is not always precise, it is
common for students to need a “DARS exception” in order to graduate; these
exceptions are handled by the CS Graduate Advisor.
</p>
<h3 id="11-4-incompletes">11.4 Incompletes</h3>
<p>
In exceptional circumstances, students can arrange to receive an Incomplete (I)
grade for a course, giving them more time to complete course requirements. See
<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/incomplete-grades">this page</a> for
more detailed information.
</p>
<h3 id="11-5-petitions">11.5 Petitions</h3>
<p>
Exceptions to policies imposed by the Graduate School and University require a
formal petition process. The CS Graduate Advisor can assist in preparing
petitions, but it is the student’s responsibility to file them with appropriate
supporting documentation. University petitions go to one of two university-wide
faculty committees (Deadline Appeals Committee or Graduate Council), depending
on their time frame. See <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/registration/petitions">this page</a> for more
detailed information.
</p>
<h3 id="11-6-joint-campus-registration-with-ohsu">11.6 Joint Campus Registration
with OHSU</h3>
<p>
Admitted graduate students at Portland State may take graduate courses offered
by Oregon Health and Science University and have the credits included in their
current term enrollment and tuition assessment at PSU. Only specific courses are
approved for this<a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/joint-campus-registration"> joint campus
arrangement</a>. Students must have permission from the instructor of the OHSU
course as well as their home department to use the joint campus registration
process and apply the OHSU courses to their PSU degree. Contact the CS Graduate
Advisor (gccs@pdx.edu) for details.
</p>
<h3 id="11-7-psu-code-of-conduct">11.7 PSU Code of conduct</h3>
<p>
Students should be familiar with the university’s <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/dean-student-life/psu-code-student-conduct-and-responsibility
">student code of conduct</a>, which describes the rights and responsibilities
of PSU community members.
</p>
<h3 id="11-8-academic-misconduct-and-plagiarism">11.8 Academic Misconduct and
Plagiarism</h3>
<p>
The CS department follows the university’s general rules on <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/dean-student-life/academic-misconduct">academic
misconduct</a>. Students should note that the particular rules for independent
work and the use of generative AI may differ widely among CS courses, and they
should consult the course syllabus for more detailed information.
</p>
<h3 id="11-9-intellectual-property">11.9 Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>
In general, Portland State retains <a
href="https://www.pdx.edu/research/ip-policies-guidelines">intellectual
property</a> rights for all work done by its employees, including funded
research assistants. Students should discuss any concerns they may have about
intellectual property, patents, open-source licensing, etc. with their Faculty
Advisor.
</p>
<h3 id="11-10-travel">11.10 Travel</h3>
<p>
Students may have the opportunity to travel on academic business, e.g. to
present papers at conferences, attend summer schools, etc. Funding for travel is
typically arranged through the student’s Faculty Advisor, although departmental
or university funding opportunities may sometimes be available. All funded
travel must follow PSU’s <a
href="https://portlandstate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UFS/pages/1992852340/405+Travel">official
travel policies</a>.
</p>
<p>
In particular, a travel authorization must be approved in advance of travel, and
a reimbursement request must be filed after travel. This <a
href="https://portlandstate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UFS/pages/1992855303/Travel+Checklist">summary</a>
has more details and pointers to the relevant forms. Students should consult
their funding source to determine the name of the “contact person” to fill in on
the travel forms. Note that airfare and conference registration are normally
paid directly by the university in advance of travel, whereas hotel costs and
meal per-diems are reimbursed after the fact; an advance on these costs can be
requested. Oregon state law requires travel to be done efficiently and cost
effectively. All travelers should take this charge seriously, and remember that
they are representing the Department and PSU when traveling.
