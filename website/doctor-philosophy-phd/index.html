   The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is the highest degree offered in the Computer Science discipline. It is intended for those who will pursue research in the field. The degree is usually required to teach Computer Science at the university level, and for employment in prestigious industrial research laboratories. Students may enter the doctoral program with a bachelor's degree or with a master's degree, provided they have adequate background in Computer Science. Since completion of the degree requires presentation of a dissertation comprising of original research, the time required is not completely predictable. Four to six years of full-time work are typical, less if the student enters with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Part-time pursuit of the degree is also possible.

   The requirements for the Ph.D. include core and elective coursework, passing a Research Proficiency Examination, writing and defending a Dissertation Proposal, and completing and defending the Dissertation itself. Throughout, the focus of the program is strongly on research.
