   What is the PSU/PDX Cooperative Education Program?
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p class="c4">
  <span class="c0">
   The PSU/PDX Cooperative Education Program (PCEP) is a two-year cooperative educational program in which Computer Science students work 20 hours per week at one of our local PCEP Partner companies in a series of defined internship roles, while concurrently taking between eight and twelve credits each term on-campus at PSU. Pay begins at $27 an hour with semi-annual raises. New internship cycles start approximately every six months (January and July), and interns must work at two or more PCEP companies in at least two different roles during the program.

  <span class="c2">
   Why Should I Care?
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p class="c4">
  <span class="c0">
   The PCEP co-op will give you real-life experience in two different roles (software development and software automation) at two or more different local software companies while allowing you to take eight to twelve credits of coursework each term on campus. Not only will you gain technical experience, you'll also learn how to work in a professional environment as part of a team developing commercial software for a global customer base, while simultaneously building your professional network. A PCEP co-op will jumpstart your career as a software professional.

   Who Qualifies?
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p class="c4">
  <span class="c0">
   Any student admitted to the B.S. Computer Science degree program at Portland State University, who will have completed CS163, CS205, CS302, and CS314, with grades of B or better, by the time their co-op begins may apply. In addition, applicants must have a 3.0 GPA overall required Computer Science coursework, be over 18, and have the permanent right to work in the United States (some positions require U.S. citizenship). See the Student Expectations for more information.

   Who are the PCEP Companies?
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p class="c4">
  <span class="c0">
   The PCEP companies are among some of the most exciting software companies in the Portland Metro area. Their markets range from computer security and web analytics to healthcare, social media solutions and county government, as well as everything in between.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCEP companies are located in downtown Portland, so students have easy walking and public transportation options for getting back and forth between work and school. Many of the PCEP companies support hybrid or completely remote internships. In becoming a PCEP Partner, each company has acknowledged the student's educational goals are primary - they have agreed the internship program must augment, not conflict, with the educational goals of the student. This results in internships that are not only valuable to the company, but are also genuine educational experiences for the student.
